Donald Trump's hush-money trial to begin 15 April,Kayla Epstein,No Fake,"Donald Trump will face the first ever criminal trial of a former US president on 15 April over alleged hush money payments to adult film star Stormy Daniels.
Justice Juan Merchan denied the defence's request to delay the case.
Mr Trump faces four criminal cases, but this may be the only one to make it to a courtroom before November's election.
He has pleaded not guilty to all 34 felony charges, arguing the claims do not constitute ""a crime"".
After spending much of Monday morning sitting next to his attorneys inside the courtroom, Mr Trump told reporters that the case should be considered ""election interference"".
""It's a disgrace, and we will obviously be appealing,"" he said. ""But this is a pure case of voter intimidation and election interference, and it shouldn't be allowed to happen.""
During his bid to retake the White House, the former president and his legal team have sought to delay as many of his trials as possible.
The trial was originally set to begin with jury selection on Monday, but it was delayed after thousands of documents were released last week from the 2018 federal investigation into the payments to Ms Daniels.
Judge Merchan held a hearing on Monday centred on whether there had been any wrongdoing in the sudden release last week of more than 200,000 pages of documents related to the federal prosecutors' case.
Mr Trump's legal team claimed the Manhattan district attorney's office had engaged in misconduct by not doing enough to get the federal prosecutors to hand over the documents in a timely manner. They alleged prosecutors were attempting to ""suppress"" evidence.
The document release followed a request by Mr Trump's attorneys in January for records from the federal case. Justice Merchan questioned why the defence had not discussed the long wait with him earlier.
The Manhattan District Attorney's office had agreed to a delay of 30 days for the documents to be reviewed, but prosecutors said at the hearing that they believed only 300 new documents needed to be considered.

A guide to Trump's four criminal cases
What happened between Stormy Daniels and Trump?
Mr Trump's legal team demanded more time to review the documents, and pushed for a 90-day delay.
On Monday, Justice Merchan grilled Mr Trump's lawyer to specify how many of the ""thousands"" of documents they would consider relevant and requiring review for this case.
Mr Trump's attorney, Todd Blanche, painted a broad picture of what was in the new batch, which he said included records from the Robert Mueller investigation - the federal inquiry into Russian interference in the 2016 election.
Though Justice Merchan pressed him to narrow his focus to the case at hand, Mr Blanche maintained that the relevant records numbered in the thousands.
""We got the material a week ago,""he said. ""We're still going through them.""
The judge, however, appeared impatient and unpersuaded by the attorney's arguments, including the claim that prosecutors had acted unethically.
During a tense exchange, Mr Blanche could not give a satisfactory argument that Mr Bragg's team had violated a statute concerning how prosecutors must share evidence.
""That you don't have a case right now is really disconcerting,"" Justice Merchan told Mr Blanche.
The judge said that the defence appeared keen on accusing prosecutors of misconduct ""and trying to make me complicit in it"", without providing a compelling legal argument.
""It's odd that we're even here and that we've taken this time,"" he said.
Justice Merchan ultimately ruled that the district attorney's office was ""not at fault"" for the late production of evidence from federal prosecutors, and made ""diligent efforts"" to produce the relevant documents.
As he gaveled the hearing to a close, Justice Merchan told Mr Trump and the dozens of assembled lawyers and press: ""See you all on the 15th."""
Trump’s biggest legal victory is in sight: presidential immunity,Alan Dershowitz,No Fake,"Many progressive pundits are predicting that the Supreme Court of the United States will deny Trump’s claim of immunity for his actions surrounding the 2020 election. They may be right, but if the justices were simply going to affirm the very broad lower court decisions, why did they grant review? Cynics claim that the justices were simply doing Trump’s bidding by slowing down his trial in Washington DC. There may however be a more reasonable and less political explanation. 
The lower court decisions were extremely broad, denying virtually any immunity for acts taken by a former president when he was in office. It is possible therefore that the court took the case in order to narrow these decisions somewhat. Presidents should have some immunity for some actions clearly within the scope of their presidential authority, and if they do, this immunity should not end when they leave office. Otherwise presidents would be fearful of taking controversial actions while serving. 
One possible decision might be for the court to articulate a narrow criteria for presidential immunity and then remand the case to the lower courts to determine whether President Trump’s actions or inactions fall within that narrow exception. 
It is true that the text of the US constitution does not provide explicitly for any presidential immunity, as it does for legislators. But nor does it provide for judicial immunity, and yet the Supreme Court has ruled that some judicial immunity is implicit in the role of judge. Moreover the constitution does not explicitly mandate any form of executive privilege for a president and his advisers, yet the justices have recognised such a privilege. 
Furthermore, the Supreme Court did rule that Richard Nixon had immunity from some forms of civil liability. There is a legitimate basis therefore for the court to find a limited form of immunity from criminal prosecution in cases where the president acted clearly within his authority as chief executive. 
The justices may have provided a hint as to what they were thinking when they framed the narrow question for review. Here is what they ask the lawyers to address: “Whether and if so to what extent does a former president enjoy presidential immunity from the criminal prosecution for conduct alleged to involve official acts during his tenure in office.” 
In articulating this question, the court rejected the proposed questions that both Trump’s lawyers and special prosecutor Smith’s lawyers had asked them to decide. It seems likely therefore that the court intends to issue a narrow legal ruling, rather than itself getting into the issue of whether Trump’s actions or inactions come within its criteria of “official acts during his tenure in office”. 
It is still possible of course that the court will simply affirm the appellate court’s decision. But if they do so, it will lend support to the cynics who have accused them of acting in a partisan fashion by simply delaying the Washington proceedings, which may not then conclude until after the election. 
It is also possible that by narrowing the question to be decided, the chief justice is once again seeking some kind of unanimity, as he achieved in the Colorado disqualification case. It is highly unlikely however that unanimity will be achieved in the immunity case, because the issue is more complex and divisive than in the disqualification case. It is likely therefore that we will see a divided opinion with dissents and concurrences. 
Pundits on both sides seem more interested in how this case will impact the candidacy of Donald Trump than in how it impacts the future of presidential immunity for future incumbents of the White House. The justices, however, may be more interested in the enduring impact of any decision they render than in its immediate impact on the coming election. 
The Supreme Court operates in secret, and except for the notorious leak regarding the overruling of Roe v. Wade, it has generally maintained secrecy until its decisions are rendered. 
Many pundits offer predictions that are based more on what they would like to see the court do than on what it is likely to do. I try my best not to allow my preferences to influence my predictions. So the only prediction I will make is that I don’t think there will be a majority for simply affirming the lower court’s decisions. "
‘Disinformation on steroids’: is the US prepared for AI’s influence on the election?,Rachel Leingang,No Fake,"The AI election is here.
Already this year, a robocall generated using artificial intelligence targeted New Hampshire voters in the January primary, purporting to be President Joe Biden and telling them to stay home in what officials said could be the first attempt at using AI to interfere with a US election. The “deepfake” calls were linked to two Texas companies, Life Corporation and Lingo Telecom.
It’s not clear if the deepfake calls actually prevented voters from turning out, but that doesn’t really matter, said Lisa Gilbert, executive vice-president of Public Citizen, a group that’s been pushing for federal and state regulation of AI’s use in politics.
“I don’t think we need to wait to see how many people got deceived to understand that that was the point,” Gilbert said.
Examples of what could be ahead for the US are happening all over the world. In Slovakia, fake audio recordings may have swayed an election in what serves as a “frightening harbinger of the sort of interference the United States will likely experience during the 2024 presidential election”, CNN reported. In Indonesia, an AI-generated avatar of a military commander helped rebrand the country’s defense minister as a “chubby-cheeked” man who “makes Korean-style finger hearts and cradles his beloved cat, Bobby, to the delight of Gen Z voters”, Reuters reported. In India, AI versions of dead politicians have been brought back to compliment elected officials, according to Al Jazeera.
But US regulations aren’t ready for the boom in fast-paced AI technology and how it could influence voters. Soon after the fake call in New Hampshire, the Federal Communications Commission announced a ban on robocalls that use AI audio. The FEC has yet to put rules in place to govern the use of AI in political ads, though states are moving quickly to fill the gap in regulation.
The US House launched a bipartisan taskforce on 20 February that will research ways AI could be regulated and issue a report with recommendations. But with partisan gridlock ruling Congress, and US regulation trailing the pace of AI’s rapid advance, it’s unclear what, if anything, could be in place in time for this year’s elections.
Without clear safeguards, the impact of AI on the election might come down to what voters can discern as real and not real. AI – in the form of text, bots, audio, photo or video – can be used to make it look like candidates are saying or doing things they didn’t do, either to damage their reputations or mislead voters. It can be used to beef up disinformation campaigns, making imagery that looks real enough to create confusion for voters.
Audio content, in particular, can be even more manipulative because the technology for video isn’t as advanced yet and recipients of AI-generated calls lose some of the contextual clues that something is fake that they might find in a deepfake video. Experts also fear that AI-generated calls will mimic the voices of people a caller knows in real life, which has the potential for a bigger influence on the recipient because the caller would seem like someone they know and trust. Commonly called the “grandparent” scam, callers can now use AI to clone a loved one’s voice to trick the target into sending money. That could theoretically be applied to politics and elections.
“It could come from your family member or your neighbor and it would sound exactly like them,” Gilbert said. “The ability to deceive from AI has put the problem of mis- and disinformation on steroids.”
There are less misleading uses of the technology to underscore a message, like the recent creation of AI audio calls using the voices of kids killed in mass shootings aimed at swaying lawmakers to act on gun violence. Some political campaigns even use AI to show alternate realities to make their points, like a Republican National Committee ad that used AI to create a fake future if Biden is re-elected. But some AI-generated imagery can seem innocuous at first, like the rampant faked images of people next to carved wooden dog sculptures popping up on Facebook, but then be used to dispatch nefarious content later on.
People wanting to influence elections no longer need to “handcraft artisanal election disinformation”, said Chester Wisniewski, a cybersecurity expert at Sophos. Now, AI tools help dispatch bots that sound like real people more quickly, “with one bot master behind the controls like the guy on the Wizard of Oz”.
Perhaps most concerning, though, is that the advent of AI can make people question whether anything they are seeing is real or not, introducing a heavy dose of doubt at a time when the technologies themselves are still learning how to best mimic reality.
“There’s a difference between what AI might do and what AI is actually doing,” said Katie Harbath, who formerly worked in policy at Facebook and now writes about the intersection between technology and democracy. People will start to wonder, she said, “what if AI could do all this? Then maybe I shouldn’t be trusting everything that I’m seeing.”
Even without government regulation, companies that manage AI tools have announced and launched plans to limit its potential influence on elections, such as having their chatbots direct people to trusted sources on where to vote and not allowing chatbots that imitate candidates. A recent pact among companies such as Google, Meta, Microsoft and OpenAI includes “reasonable precautions” such as additional labeling of and education about AI-generated political content, though it wouldn’t ban the practice.
But bad actors often flout or skirt around government regulations and limitations put in place by platforms. Think of the “do not call” list: even if you’re on it, you still probably get some spam calls.
At the national level, or with major public figures, debunking a deepfake happens fairly quickly, with outside groups and journalists jumping in to spot a spoof and spread the word that it’s not real. When the scale is smaller, though, there are fewer people working to debunk something that could be AI-generated. Narratives begin to set in. In Baltimore, for example, recordings posted in January of a local principal allegedly making offensive comments could be AI-generated – it’s still under investigation.
In the absence of regulations from the Federal Election Commission (FEC), a handful of states have instituted laws over the use of AI in political ads, and dozens more states have filed bills on the subject. At the state level, regulating AI in elections is a bipartisan issue, Gilbert said. The bills often call for clear disclosures or disclaimers in political ads that make sure voters understand content was AI-generated; without such disclosure, the use of AI is then banned in many of the bills, she said.
The FEC opened a rule-making process for AI last summer, and the agency said it expects to resolve it sometime this summer, the Washington Post has reported. Until then, political ads with AI may have some state regulations to follow, but otherwise aren’t restricted by any AI-specific FEC rules.
“Hopefully we will be able to get something in place in time, so it’s not kind of a wild west,” Gilbert said. “But it’s closing in on that point, and we need to move really fast.”"
Quite the accomplishment’: Joe Biden pokes fun at Trump’s alleged golf wins,Martin Pengelly,No Fake,"Joe Biden clapped back at Donald Trump after Trump posted a typically bizarre boast about his self-proclaimed golfing prowess.
“Congratulations, Donald,” the president told his Republican rival. “Quite the accomplishment.”
Sarcasm is hard to type but it surely suffused Biden’s words, which were posted to the platform formerly known as Twitter as part of what appears to be a broader strategy from the Biden campaign of taunting and ridiculing Trump over his legal and financial problems.
Trump made his typically capitals-splattered boast about a supposed great golfing victory on Truth Social, the platform he started when Twitter banned him for inciting the January 6 attack on Congress.
“It is my great honour,” the former president wrote, “to be at Trump International Golf Club in West Palm Beach tonight, AWARDS NIGHT, to receive THE CLUB CHAMPIONSHIP TROPHY & THE SENIOR CLUB CHAMPIONSHIP TROPHY. I WON BOTH!
“A large and golfing talented membership, a GREAT and difficult course, made the play very exciting. The qualifying and match play was amazing … Very exciting, thank you!!!”
Biden’s tweet followed. Many other social media users quoted Rick Reilly, a former Sports Illustrated columnist and author of Commander in Cheat: How Golf Explains Trump.
Reilly, who has played with the former president, has described how Trump “cheats like a mafia accountant”, including “kick[ing] the ball out of the rough so many times, the caddies call him Pele”, taking endless free shots and falsifying scores.
On Sunday, Reilly told Trump: “Call us if you ever win one on a course you DON’T own and operate.”
Trump’s dubious claims to honours and titles at his own courses are well documented. Notably, his West Palm Beach club was revealed in 2017 to list him as its 1999 champion. It opened in 2000.
Away from the fairways, Trump secured the Republican nomination to face Biden again this year despite facing 88 criminal charges, multimillion-dollar civil penalties and attempts to remove him from the ballot.
On Monday, Trump faces a hearing in his New York criminal case over hush-money payments to the adult film star Stormy Daniels – who he met at a celebrity golf event in Nevada – and a deadline to pay a $454m bond in a civil fraud suit, also in New York.
Golf courses are among Trump assets the Democratic attorney general of New York, Letitia James, could try to seize if Trump does not pay up.
Biden’s campaign has seized on Trump’s financial troubles, taunting him as “Broke Don”. The weekend saw a social media surge for the nickname “Don Poorleone”, a play on Trump’s mob-like approach to politics and Don Corleone, the name of the mafia boss played by Marlon Brando in the Godfather saga.
On Monday, meanwhile, Edward-Isaac Dovere, author of Battle for the Soul, a book on Biden’s victory in 2020, noted an interesting point.
So far in the 2024 campaign, Dovere wrote, Trump “has taken more time for golf tournaments than campaign events. Last night, Trump bragged about winning at golf – while still no campaign events booked.”
Most users, however, focused on mocking Trump’s golf-based braggadocio, many raising amusing parallels with another former world leader.
“According to North Korean media Kim Jong Il scored 11 holes-in-one on his very first round of golf,” said Gideon Rachman, author of The Age of the Strongman: How the Cult of the Leader Threatens Democracy Around the World.
“So Trump has a way to go.”"
Biden administration indicts and sanctions Chinese hackers accused of sweeping espionage campaign against US targets,"By Sean Lyngaas and Evan Perez, CNN",No Fake,"The Biden administration on Monday announced a criminal indictment and sanctions against multiple Chinese hackers for allegedly conducting sweeping hacks against US companies and government officials on behalf of China’s civilian intelligence service.
Seven Chinese men were indicted in US federal court in the Eastern District of New York and accused of being part of a yearslong hacking effort that resulted in the “confirmed and potential compromise” of data belonging to millions of Americans, some of “which could be released in support of malign influence” targeting US democratic institutions, the indictment states.
The hackers targeted “some of America’s most vital critical infrastructure sectors,” including a defense contractor that made flight simulators for the US military, the US Treasury Department said while announcing sanctions against two of the men. The State Department announced a reward of up to $10 million for information on the seven men.
The alleged hacking effort was vast. Over the course of just a few months in 2018, the hackers sent more than 10,000 malicious emails to senior US officials (and their advisers) in the White House, Justice Department and other agencies, and to Democratic and Republican senators in more than 10 states, according to the indictment. The hackers allegedly posed as prominent US journalists as a ruse to try to get targets to click on the emails.
The US announcement came as the British government said the same broad group of Chinese hackers had “highly likely” breached the UK Electoral Commission in 2021 and 2022, and had conducted digital reconnaissance against British parliamentarians. The activity did not affect the UK electoral process or voters’ rights or registration, Britain’s foreign office said.
CNN first reported earlier Monday that the US government actions were imminent.
“Without valid evidence, the US jumped to an unwarranted conclusion and made groundless accusations against China,” Liu Pengyu, a spokesperson for the Chinese Embassy in Washington, DC, said in a statement to CNN responding to the US announcement.
China’s Foreign Ministry earlier Monday condemned reports that the British government was preparing to link Beijing to hacking operations targeting the UK Electoral Commission and lawmakers, telling reporters that it opposes countries “politicizing” cybersecurity.
The moves come at a particularly delicate time in US-China cyber relations, weeks after FBI Director Christopher Wray issued a dire public warning that a different group of Chinese hackers was preparing “to wreak havoc and cause real-world harm to American citizens and communities, if or when China decides the time has come to strike.”
At a meeting in November, Chinese President Xi Jinping assured US President Joe Biden that China would not interfere in the 2024 US election — an assurance that US officials are not taking at face value, CNN previously reported.
Beijing has vigorously denied the US allegations of hacking and in turn accused the US of conducting its own hacking operations against China.
The US announcement Monday focused on alleged Chinese cyber-espionage instead of the possible disruptive cyberattacks highlighted by Wray.
US officials alleged the seven Chinese men named in the indictment have been using a Chinese technology company as a front to cover their hacking activity on behalf of China’s powerful Ministry of State Security. CNN has attempted to reach the company, known as Wuhan Xiaoruizhi Science and Technology Company, for comment.
The cybersecurity industry knows the hacking group as APT31 or Judgement Panda, and researchers have found the hackers targeting everything from US law firms to European industrial organizations to international apparel companies.
Ahead of the 2020 US election, hackers associated with the group had unsuccessfully tried to break into email accounts of people affiliated with the Biden campaign, according to Microsoft. It was not immediately clear whether any of the men expected to be named this week were allegedly involved in that activity.
Monday’s announcement isn’t the first time the Chinese government’s extensive cyber capabilities have been traced back to contractors working for front companies.
A trove of documents leaked last month from another Chinese tech firm, I-Soon, showed victims of the firm’s hacking from Tibet to Hong Kong. Clients listed in contracts with the firm included China’s police, intelligence service and military, according to the leaked data."
Trump Demands Recount After Biden Has More Positive COVID Tests Than He Did,Andy Borowitz,Fake,"WASHINGTON (The Borowitz Report) - Donald J. Trump has demanded an immediate recount of covid tests after it emerged that President Biden had tested positive more times than he did.
A fuming Trump told reporters that “the only way Sleepy Joe could beat me at covid is if the tests were rigged.”
Lending Trump support was his former attorney Rudolph Giuliani, who claimed that Biden’s most recent covid test was “rife with fraud.”
“These covid tests are like a Breathalyzer,” Giuliani said. “You blow into the thing when you’re perfectly fine, and it registers that you’re drunk off your ass.”
Trump asserted that once a recount is performed, he will have topped Biden’s positive tests in a landslide. “Frankly, we did win this infection,” he said."
White Nationalists Give Mar-a-Lago Restaurant Disappointing One-Star Reviews on Tripadvisor,Andy Borowitz,Fake,"In the latest setback for Donald J. Trump, the restaurant at his Florida club, Mar-a-Lago, has received an avalanche of scathing Tripadvisor reviews from white nationalists.
Although the publicity surrounding Trump’s recent dinner with Kanye West and Nick Fuentes seemed likely to boost the club’s popularity with anti-Semitic foodies, the one-star reviews from neo-Nazis suggest otherwise.
One Tripadvisor reviewer, using the handle JosephGoebbels2024, echoed the opinions of other white-nationalist commenters when he complained that the Mar-a-Lago restaurant had “slow service,” “drab décor,” and “too many ethnic dishes.”
According to a source close to Trump, the former President was shaken by the one-star reviews. “He kind of assumed that, no matter what, the white supremacists would be with him,” the source said. “He had no idea they were such picky eaters.”"
Chinese Spy Balloon Finds No Information at Fox News,Andy Borowitz,Fake,"A Chinese spy balloon hovered over the midtown Manhattan headquarters of Fox News for several days but found no information, Pentagon officials have confirmed.
The balloon, reportedly frustrated in its attempt to detect anything of a factual nature emanating from the cable news network’s home base, gave up its mission and went home.
A Pentagon spokesman defended the military’s decision not to shoot down the balloon over Fox. “Honestly, we couldn’t figure out why it was there,” he said.
Sources indicate that the Chinese President, Xi Jinping, is “furious” at the military leaders who sent the balloon to spy on Fox.
“This was a waste of a perfectly good balloon,” Xi reportedly shouted.

Trump Angrily Orders Pence to Return All Classified Documents to Mar-a-Lago,Andy Borowitz,Fake,"Minutes after it was revealed that classified documents were found at Mike Pence’s home in Indiana, Donald J. Trump demanded that his former Vice-President return all of the secret materials to Mar-a-Lago “at once.”
An incandescently angry Trump addressed the media at his Palm Beach home and accused his former running mate of being “the lowest form of life” for taking documents “that were rightfully mine.”
“Mike Pence took documents from the White House without asking me first if I wanted to take them,” he said. “Mike Pence kept me from having a complete collection of documents, and that, quite frankly, is a disgrace.”
Calling Pence “a total snake in the grass,” Trump said, “All the time he was sucking up to me, he was busy shoving documents down his pants. Some Christian!”
He added that “the Constitution needs to be rewritten” to keep future Vice-Presidents from taking documents that the President might want. “This should never be allowed to happen in our country,” he said."
Jon Stewart Knows “The Daily Show” Can’t Save Democracy,Inkoo Kang,Fake,"When Jon Stewart announced that he would return to “The Daily Show” as a part-time host, the reaction among fans was split. The nostalgists were vindicated on Monday night: there was no trace of rust in his twenty-minute opening monologue, during which he addressed the age and apparent infirmity of Joe Biden and Donald Trump. The jokes could’ve been written entirely by Stewart, whose comedic voice—reasonable, conversational, a little sophomoric—was remarkably unchanged despite nine years away. After riffing on the special counsel’s report that damned Biden as a “sympathetic, well-meaning, elderly man with a poor memory,” Stewart argued in favor of intellectual honesty over knee-jerk partisanship: “It is not crazy to think that the oldest people in the history of the country to ever run for President might have some of these challenges . . . What’s crazy is thinking that we’re the ones, as voters, who must silence concerns and criticisms.” He cautioned against nihilistic indifference and false equivalencies—and, notably, did not bother to reassure the audience. “If your guy loses, bad things might happen, but the country is not over,” he said. “And if your guy wins, the country is in no way saved.”
I’ll admit that, on hearing the news of Stewart’s reappearance, I was among the skeptics; I’ve long thought that, with his accomplishments on “The Daily Show,” he had transformed late night so completely that he’d made himself redundant. But he won me over by the end of his fifty-minute “première” by acknowledging the unrealistic hopes pinned on his homecoming, as well as the critiques he’s received from the left. The host dropped all pretense of irony when he admitted he’d previously been “glib at best” and “probably dismissive at worst” about the slog required to enact positive change. The correspondent Jordan Klepper, who will host the week’s remaining episodes, tauntingly asked Stewart, “Did you save democracy yet with your nineties brand of snark and both-sider-isms?” Another correspondent, Dulcé Sloan, drew the obvious parallel between the candidates’ recurrence and Stewart’s own: “We need more than just the same show with an older yet familiar face.” That’s true, and yet, by hinting at how he’s rethought some of his stances, Stewart has made us curious once again about what he has to say.
In the near-decade since he gave up his hosting chair, Stewart’s influence has only grown, even as his reputation lost some of its lustre. That he’s struggled to find (or create) a post-“Daily Show” vehicle for himself is no secret. Critics noted the lack of satirical bite in the 2020 election comedy “Irresistible,” which he wrote and directed. His subsequent return to current affairs, the gravely serious Apple TV+ series “The Problem with Jon Stewart,” was cancelled after two seasons—a casualty of poor ratings and, reportedly, of “creative differences” with Apple over his plans to discuss A.I. and China. (Last night, when laying out his vision for the new “Daily Show,” he wryly alluded to the possibility of talking about both.) After sitting out most of the Trump years—an era when politics got nastier and crazier at hurricane speeds—Stewart has come back to a democracy in tatters and the very real possibility of another Trump victory in November. He’s never been tested like this before.
Still, his fans could be forgiven for considering him their best chance at making sense of it all. After taking over “The Daily Show” from Craig Kilborn, in 1999, Stewart turned the series into essential viewing for a certain slice of the electorate, including myself. (I got hooked as a college student during the George W. Bush Administration; from that point until Stewart’s departure, in 2015, I never missed an episode.) As a comedian, Stewart was able to be two things his journalistic counterparts weren’t: partisan and emotional. In a post-9/11 media environment that stifled dissenting voices—and at a time when many Americans were dismayed by the injustices committed in their name—Stewart reacted to the news the way a normal person might, freely expressing anger, exasperation, and disbelief. Because he wasn’t pretending to be above or unaffected by the events of the day, processing them alongside him felt more bearable. “The Daily Show” came to feel like a nightly check-in with your smartest friend.
The series didn’t depend on access to politicians, so Stewart could be more forceful in calling out their hypocrisies than the mainstream media, which became a target of his ire in its own right. The infamous 2004 face-off in which he dressed down Tucker Carlson on his own show, the CNN debate program “Crossfire,” for “hurting America” by engaging in “theatre” instead of genuine dialogue, both cemented Stewart’s fame and displayed the potency of his critiques. “Crossfire” was cancelled, and Carlson eventually landed at Fox News, another “Daily Show” bête noire. In the decades since, Fox’s popularity—and detachment from reality—has only increased. The fates of the on-air personalities Stewart once mocked are revealing. Glenn Beck, whom he regularly satirized in the early Obama years, has disappeared from traditional news altogether; so has Bill O’Reilly, whose daily pontifications Stewart and Stephen Colbert parodied via “The Colbert Report.” Carlson’s radicalization outpaced that of Fox itself, which he has since left under a cloud; last week, he flew to Moscow to conduct a softball interview with Vladimir Putin. Garnering high ratings on the network’s current lineup, though, is Greg Gutfeld’s late-night comedy talk show “Gutfeld!”—Fox’s own “Daily Show.”
Stewart’s greatest legacy may be that late night as a whole has come to feel like Resistance TV. Nightly updates on the political crisis du jour can be found not only on a relatively niche network like Comedy Central but on broadcasters like CBS, ABC, and NBC, from hosts Colbert, Jimmy Kimmel, and Seth Meyers, respectively. Kimmel, once an anodyne bro, now cheerfully torments the far-right conspiracy theorist Mike Lindell and keeps tabs on the antics of the Republican congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene. Meanwhile, studiously apolitical talk shows once helmed by the likes of Jay Leno and David Letterman feel on the verge of extinction. Jimmy Fallon’s decade-old “Tonight Show” may be the last gasp of that era. When Taylor Tomlinson, the ultra-popular millennial comic, got her own insomniacs’ program, “After Midnight,” on CBS last month, she opted out of the topical-takes-and-celebrity-interview format entirely, preferring, instead, to preside over a game show.
Stewart returns to “The Daily Show” after many of its alumni—Stephen Colbert, John Oliver, Samantha Bee, Hasan Minhaj, Michelle Wolf, Larry Wilmore, and Jordan Klepper—landed “late-night” series of their own, nearly all of them spiritual spinoffs. Only two have avoided cancellation. Though Colbert in particular remains close to Stewart, perhaps his truest successor on the airwaves today is Seth Meyers, another silver-haired, casual-dad type from the Northeast who scans as both “news junkie” and “fundamentally good dude.” Meyers pivoted hard during Trump’s first bid for the Presidency, deliberately setting out to fill the void left by Stewart. He’s proved adept at offering the same kind of tether to sanity, reminding viewers that huge swaths of the country remain “normal,” even if Republicans have become more extreme. But in general, political humor is moving on from its reliance on a white male Everyman. As marginalized groups contend with renewed hostility from the right, we’ve come to value late night as a venue for insight into the personal impact of policy changes and culture wars—another shift that Stewart’s “Daily Show” recognized early, increasing the diversity of its correspondents by tapping such talents as Trevor Noah and Hasan Minhaj. Noah’s most memorable segments as host were informed by his experiences as a South African outsider; Minhaj broke out in part by discussing Trump’s Muslim Ban through the lens of his own fears about being separated from his family. Both pushed the genre forward—though neither was quite the heir “The Daily Show” needed them to be. (Minhaj was reportedly the network’s choice to take over until a piece in this magazine revealed that he had fabricated anecdotes about discrimination for his standup specials. In a response video, Minhaj defended himself by asserting that “comedic storytelling” can have a looser relationship with the truth.)
Stewart intends to host “The Daily Show” through Election Day. In order to succeed, whoever comes after him will need to avoid the excesses of the format that he popularized: so-called clapter comedy, a phrase that has been credited to Meyers which describes the kind of jokes that, instead of making audiences laugh, elicit applause by pandering to their preëxisting beliefs. Stewart resorted to such lines at least occasionally during his tenure; in the Trump era, the tactic exploded. The use of clapter as a crutch, and a general ethos against “punching down” among moral-minded standups, has rendered much of today’s political comedy predictable.
One welcome respite from this trend is the “Saturday Night Live” segment “Weekend Update,” whose hosts, Colin Jost and Michael Che, may well represent the future of the form. Rather than ape generic news anchors, as their predecessors did, Jost and Che play up their individual comic personae as the Harvard grad with “a very punchable face” and the thin-skinned Black edgelord. Their iteration of “Weekend Update” is bracing in part because it’s never obvious in which direction the punches will fly: The duo might say what we’re all thinking about Trump, or gratuitously troll the audience, or even turn on each other. Rather than fretting over whether they’re saying the “right” things, Jost and Che give themselves the freedom to tell the funniest jokes, regardless of their relationship to the comedians’ actual convictions.
That likely won’t fly for a “Daily Show” host. The program remains Comedy Central’s most storied institution, and Stewart, in his heyday, was considered by many to be a more reliable news source than actual journalists; that bond of trust with viewers is one of his less appreciated innovations. Minhaj’s apparently aborted deal suggests that, from the perspective of the network, trustworthiness, or at least the perception thereof, is still a non-negotiable requirement for the job. Stewart himself is one of the few who’s managed to serve as both jester and oracle: a figure who can channel the truth and entertain us while doing it. His next challenge is to make his voice indispensable until November—and to set the stage for what follows. He ended last night’s monologue with a paean to activists that also revealed his own motives for returning. Even after you “grind away on issues” to effect change, he said, there’s still a duty “to stay on to make sure that result holds.” "
